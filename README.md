## 📌 Lab Objectives (Pre-Scan Phase)

- Set up and configure Nessus Essentials in a Windows/Linux VM
- Review scanning policies, targets, and credentialed scan options
- Define scope and ethical usage boundaries for vulnerability scans
- Prepare documentation templates for scan reports, remediation tracking, and lab notes

## 🛡️ Ethical Disclaimer

This lab is for **educational purposes only** and operates on non-production, consented systems. No scanning of public IPs or unauthorized networks will be conducted. All demonstrations prioritize responsible security practices.
